# Hygieia Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hygieia! Developers like you help this project to succeed.

In order to ensure the highest standards of security and code quality, we have laid out some guidelines to follow when contributing to Hygieia.

## General Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

* PR's should fix one issue or add/update one feature. If you would like to update/add multiple features, please separate your changes into individual PRs so that they can be adequately reviewed.
* PR titles should be succint and descriptive. The "description" field should specify which issue/feature the PR relates to, give an overview of changes made, and highlight any specific lines or files that may need extra review.
* If applicable, please include screenshots or videos of new features to assist in review.

## Testing and Linting
* Please run ```ng lint``` and address any errors before requesting review.
* We use [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for testing. Before opening your PR, please add unit tests for any new features and update any existing ones necessary for the test suite to pass.
* Minmum 80% coverage should be met for branch, line, statement, and function coverage
  *  ** As of now, the existing codebase does not meet these standards. We are working on getting to this level of coverage, and you can do you part by making sure any new code abides by these testing guidelines **
## To raise an issue/ report a bug
* Please use github issues and include a detailed description, including screenshots if applicable.

Thanks again for your help, and we look forward to seeing the great new features you contribute to the Hygieia ecosystem!
